## Build
You can build by executing the following commands:

```
$ bash build_docker.sh
```

following files generated.

| File | Content |
|:---|:---|
| `build/sses/sses_client/libsses_client.so` | Client library |
| `build/sses/sses_server/libsses_server.so` | Server library |
| `build/sses/sses_share/libsses_share.so` | Shared library |
| `build/stdsc/stdsc/libstdsc.so` | stdsc library (see: stdsc/README.md) |
| `build/demo/client/client` | Client demo app |
| `build/demo/server/server` | Server demo app |

## Run

1. Start docker container
```
$ bash run_container.sh start
```
2. Allow to make connections to the X server from docker
```
$ xhost local:
```
3. Run demo app on docker
```
$ docker exec -it sses bash
[root@xxxxxxxx]# bash demo.sh
```
4. Stop docker container
```
$ bash run_container.sh stop
```

## Demo App
The demo app consists of two processes, `Client` and `Server`. These processes communicate as shown in the following figure.

### Processing Phase

![](doc/images/sses_design-flow_processing_phase.png)

### Client
* Usage
    ```sh
    client [-h] [-i IP Address] [-p PORT] [-c ContextSetting] [-k FHE key ID] age gender list-of-query-medicines query-side-effects

    positional arguments:
      age                       Age
      gender                    Gender (m:f:o)
      list-of-query-medicines   List of query medicines
      query-side-effects        Query side effects

    optional arguments:
      -h                        Show this help
      -i <IP Address>           IP Address (default: 127.0.0.1)
      -p <PORT>                 PORT (default: 80)
      -c <ContextSetting>       FHE context setting file
      -k <FHE key ID>           FHE key ID
    ```

* How it works?
    * Try to connect to `[IP Address]:[PORT]`.
    * Receive [age] [gender] [number of query medicine] [List of query medicines] [number of query side effects] [List of query side effects] from user.
    * Generates FHE context and keys. (Fig1. (1))
    * Send FHE context and public key to Server. (Fig. (2))
    * Encrypted [age] [gender] into [(Encrypted) query mask]. (Fig2. (3))
    * Send [(Encrypted) query mask] [number of query medicine] [List of query medicines] [number of query side effects] [List of query side effects] to server. (Fig2. (4))
    * Receive the result of each chunk sent by server. (Fig2. (6))
    * Decrypt the result. find 0's inside, and tell server `pair<chunk id, position id>` is desired. (Fig2. (7))
    * Receive the auxiliary data from server and output to user. (Fig2. (9)(10))

### Server
* Usage
    ```sh
    server [-p PORT] [-q Max Queries] [-r Max Results] [-l Max Result Lifetime] [-t NThreads] [-d DB direcotry] [-f CSV filepath]
    
    positional arguments:

    optional arguments:
      -h                         Show this help
      -p <PORT>                  PORT (default: 80)
      -q <Max Queries>           Max number of queries the server will accept (default: 128)
      -r <Max Results>           Max number of results the server will hold (default: 128)
      -l <Max Result Lifetime>   Lifetime of results (sec) (default: 50000)
      -t <NTHreads>              Number of threads used for calculations per query (default: 28)
      -d <DB dDirectory>         The directory where the server stores the database files (default: .)
      -f <CSV filepath>          DB of medical records
    ```

* How it works?
    * Listen to PORT until a user replies.
    * Receive FHE context and public key. (Fig1. (2))
    * From the generated dummy data, initialize the inverted index med.inv and side.inv. (Fig1. (3'))
    * Generate Encrypted records from a plaintext record using encrypted [mask]. (Fig1. (3'))
    * Receive [(Encrypted) query mask] [number of query medicine] [List of query medicines] [number of query side effects] [List of query side effects] from client. (Fig2. (4))
    * Filter by `query medicines` and `query side effects` using **merge of inverted index**.
    * Split the filtered result into chunks of (100, 500, 1000, 2000), extract the ciphertext `mask` from files. Put them into slots. each chunk one `Ctxt`. Multithreading begins.
    * Subtract with [(Encrypted) query mask] got in step 2.
    * Broaden the range from `-5` to `+5`, get a `vector<Ctxt>` of 11 elements.
    * Use a pyramidal way to do `Î ` (this step will greatly consume level): `11` -> `6` -> `3` -> `2` -> `1`
    * The result is timed with a random integer within `1 - 256`.
    * The result is returned back to the user, sepearted with chunks. (Fig2. (6))
    * Receive the user's reply of which record(s) the user want. (Fig2. (7))
    * Give user the auxiliary information of the wanted records. (Fig2. (8)(9))
