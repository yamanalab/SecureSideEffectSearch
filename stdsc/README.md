## Client
* Behavior
    * Client sends valueA (=10) to server. (Fig: (1))
    * Client sends valueB (=20) to server. (Fig: (2))
    * Client sends compute request to server. (Fig: (3))
    * Client sends result request to server, then receives the result (=30). (Fig: (5), (5'))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage ./client
    ```

## Server
* Behavior
    * Server receives valueA (=10) from client. (Fig: (1))
    * Server receives valueB (=20) from client. (Fig: (2))
    * Server receives compute request from client, then adds valueA and B. (Fig: (4))
    * Server receives result request from client, then return the result (=30). (Fig: (5), (5'))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage ./server
